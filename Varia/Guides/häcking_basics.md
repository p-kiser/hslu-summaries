## Color Coded Hats

Like the cowboys in the Old West, hackers use [color coded hats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_and_white_hat_symbolism_in_film) to inform the world about their moral alignment.

* A **black hat** is someone who tries to subvert a security system to gain access or control over a system against the will of the owner to use it for his own purpose.

* A **white hat** is someone who is specially authorized by the owner to find vulnerabilities in a system. This is called **penetration testing**.

* A **gray hat** is someone who does not have the permission of the system owner but has no intent to exploit vulnerabilities but rather to make a system more secure by informing the owner.

* A **green hat** is someone who uses his _hackerskillz_ primarily to _frogpost_ on mongolian basket weave forums.

Even though the motivation differs between the different hat colors, the tools, procedures and the required knowledge is generally the same.

## Vulnerabilities and Exploits

The essence of hacking is the exploitation of security flaws in software components, devices and computer networks. These flaws are called **vulnerabilities**. Using these vulnerabilities to gain access to a system is called **exploitation** of those vulnerabilities.

### Vulnerabilities

No network or computer is 100% safe, because it has to be possible to access information on a system for it to be usable.

#### Humans

By far the biggest security flaw in computer systems are the users. Exploiting the bad habits of or lack of knowledge of users is usually the easiest way to gain access to system.

The most sophisticated intrusion preventing systems and firewall can be rendered useless by just one user leaving his password written on a note, opening a malicious email attachment or plugging in a USB drive they found on the parking lot.

#### Software

All computer systems rely on software (or _firmware_) to translate user commands to action. Software is used to manage user authorization, database queries, access to hardware and peripherals and other aspects that can be exploited.

Since it is nearly impossible to anticipate every feasible vulnerability while writing a piece of software, programmers usually rely on patches to fix vulnerabilities after they are found. While some vulnerabilities are actual errors in the code, most vulnerabilities originate from using software in unanticipated ways.
